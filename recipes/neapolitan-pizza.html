      <h2>Perfect Neapolitan Pizza</h2>
      <p>
        Once you've tasted Neapolitan pizza, you'll never go back. Then you'll
        spend the rest of your life trying to recreate it at home! Luckily, we
        did that for you. Here are all our tips and tricks for the best homemade
        Neapolitan pizza, so you can enjoy it for a lifetime!
      </p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 ball Best Homemade Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>1/3 cup Easy Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 basil leaves</li>
        <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Prepare the dough using the Best Pizza Dough recipe (follow this video
          instruction for more). Follow the preparation instructions in the
          dough recipe if prepared in advance.
        </li>
        <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500F.</li>
        <li>
          Slice the mozzarella into 1/4 inch thick pieces. If it's incredibly
          watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to let it sit
          on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the
          mozzarella with the paper towel to remove any additional moisture.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the oven is ready, stretch the dough into a circle; see How to
          Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Sprinkle a pizza peel with
          semolina flour or cornmeal, then carefully place the dough on top.
          Spread the pizza sauce across the dough. Top with mozzarella cheese.
          Taste a bite of the mozzarella cheese; if it does not taste salty, add
          a few pinches of kosher salt to the pizza.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you're baking in a pizza oven, add the basil leaves. For baking in
          a standard oven, add the basil leaves after you bake (the leaves turn
          black in a standard oven).
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the pizza to the pizza stone on the pizza peel, then bake
          until the cheese is melted, about 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute
          in the pizza oven). Slice into pieces and serve immediately.
        </li>
